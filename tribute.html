      <p>Marie Curie was a Polish-born physicist and chemist who was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize. She was born in Warsaw, Poland, in 1867 and went on to study physics and mathematics at the University of Paris. In 1903, she and her husband, Pierre Curie, shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for their work on radiation.</p>
      
      <p>Marie Curie's contributions to science were significant. She discovered two new elements, polonium and radium, and coined the term "radioactivity." She also pioneered the use of radiation in medicine, developing mobile X-ray units to treat soldiers during World War I. Marie Curie was an inspiration to many and a pioneer in her field.</p>
